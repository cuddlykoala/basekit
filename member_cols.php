                  was born in Shiraz, Iran, and lived there until she was 22
                  years old. In 2006, she obtained her Bachelor of Science
                  (BS) in Materials Engineering-Metallurgy from Shiraz
                  University. Her BS project was about superplasticity of
                  ceramics. She then left for Singapore to pursue a Master
                  in the field of Mechanical Engineering-Manufacturing at
                  Nanyang Technological University. For her Master’s
                  project, she worked on the crystallization and growth
                  kinetics of nano CeO2 powder prepared via homogeneous
                  precipitation and also studied the sintering and
                  mechanical properties of CeO2-based nano composite. In
                  2008 she finished her Master’s in Singapore, and went back
                  to her home country. In winter 2010 she joined Mcgill for
                  her PhD, and currently she is working with Prof Cerruti in
                  the field of biomaterials engineering. For her PhD
                  project, she is working on the synthesis of hydroxyapatite
                  (HA), which is the main inorganic component of bone. Her
                  goal is to determine the inhibitory or promoting effect of
                  a variety of biomolecules like amino acids (AAs) and
                  peptides on HA crystallization at physiological
                  conditions. For this purpose, she is using different
                  characterization techniques, such as FT-IR, ICP, XRD, XPS,
                  TEM, and SEM. She is also planning on modeling HA
                  crystallization based on kinetical and thermodynamical
                  results, in order to determine the growth mechanism of HA
                  in the presence of AAs. </p>

                <p>Hesam was

                  materials biomedical applications. In August 2008, for
                  enriching his knowledge in biomedical engineering, he
                  started his master in the <a href="http://sti.epfl.ch/page-1617-en.html">Materials
                    Science and Engineering department</a> <a href="http://sti.epfl.ch/cms/page-1647.html">(Orientation

                  In 2010, after finishing his Master, Hesam joined Prof.
                  Cerruti’s group as a research assistant and later on as a
                  PhD student. His current research is focused on
                  modification of biodegradable PDLLA scaffolds used in bone
                  applications. His goal is to increase the degradation rate
                  of PDLLA scaffolds, and to modify their surface and bulk
                  with Bioglass and other bioactive agents to enhance bone

                <p>Jinke was
                  born and grew up in the city of Harbin, northern China. In
                  2008, he received his B.Eng degree in Materials Science
                  and Engineering, from Harbin Institute of Technology.
                  During his undergraduate research, Jinke focused on the
                  hydroxyapatite deposition on TiO2 and CaTiO3 ceramics.
                  Since then, he started having great interest in
                  biomaterials research. In 2009, he decided to explore the
                  world so he came to Canada. He received his M.Sc degree in
                  Biosystems Engineering from the University of Manitoba
                  within 2 years. In 2011, Jinke joined Prof. Cerruti's
                  group as a PhD student, co-supervised by Prof. Barralet.
                  This gave him a great opportunity to continue his interest
                  in biomaterials. His current research area is oral drug
                  delivery of calcitonin using ceramics microspheres. He is
                  trying to investigate the mucoadhesive properties of
                  different ceramics microspheres, and then figure out which
                  is the suitable transporter to carry and deliver
                  calcitonin to small intestinal mucosa. In order to
                  increase the mucoadhesive properties, he endeavors to
                  modify the surface of the microspheres with help from
                  Tuan. <br>
                  In his spare time, Jinke likes sports and music. He plays
                  squash better than most beginners. He used to write songs
                  with his 30-year-old guitar but now he cannot even
                  remember a word. Jinke always dreams to have a personal
                  concert :) </p>

              Pakistan in August 2008. During my bachelors degree I
              worked on "The effect of post weld heat treatment on the
              mechanical and micro-structural properties of weldment
              between two dissimilar steels AISI 1045 and DIN 20MnCr5."
              I worked as QA/QC Engineer at Descon Engineering Limited
              and Ittefaq Sons Pvt. Limited for around one and half
              year, to acquire some corporate professional experience. I
              moved to South Korea in March 2010, to pursue my Master's

              Hanyang University, under the sponsorship of the Higher

              <p>Danae comes
                from Hermosillo, a city in the northwest region of Mexico.
                In 2010 she received a B. Sc. degree in Chemical
                Engineering (major in Metallurgics) from Sonora
                University. Her undergraduate thesis involved the
                synthesis and evaluation of the bioactive properties of
                composites made of hydroxyapatite, wollastonite and
                chitosan, as scaffolds for bone regeneration. After
                finishing her undergraduate studies, she moved to
                Ensenada, Mexico, to start her Master in Materials Science
                and Engineering at the Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials
                Research Center (CNyN) from the National Autonomous
                University of Mexico (UNAM). During her master, she worked
                on the functionalization of carbon nanotubes with
                cyclodextrins for pharmaceutical applications, and
                obtained her M. Sc. degree in 2013. To continue her
                studies in the biomaterials field, Danae joined Prof.
                Cerruti’s group in Winter 2014 as a PhD candidate. Her
                current project is focused on finding an alternative
                pathway to treat malaria from a biomaterial’s approach by
                inhibiting or reversing malaria pigment biomineralization.

                comes from Montpellier, a city in the South of France. In
                2012, she received a B. Sc. degree in Chemistry from the
                University of Lyon in France. Then, she graduated in Drug
                Sciences, specialization "Analytical Development and
                Biopharmaceutics", at the University of Lyon in 2014.
                During this time, she did an internship at the Faculty of
                Pharmacy at the University of Montreal. Her thesis project
                title was "The embedding of chitosan-based nanogels in
                macrogels for the controlled release of active substances
                for the local treatment of defective cartilage". In
                January 2015, Ophélie joined Prof. Cerruti’s group as a
                PhD student. Her research is focused on the understanding
                of the effect of elastin on blood vessel mineralization
                and the interactions between elastin and a
                biomineralization inhibitor, the matrix-gla-protein (MGP).
