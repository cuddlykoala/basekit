<li class="li1"><b>Where are you from?</b>
  <br>
  Calgary, Alberta</li>
<li class="li1"><b>What do you study at school?</b>
  <br>Economics, with minors in Finance and Political Science</li>
<li class="li1"><b>How do you spend your free time?</b><br>
  Hahaha… free time? When I am able to find some I like to hang out with friends, golf, and catch up on guilty pleasure TV shows.</li>
<li class="li1"><b>What songs are you bumpin’ tight now?</b>
  <br>Sam Smith, my ginger soul mate Ed Sheeran, and as always the Civil Wars</li>
<li class="li1"><b>What is your musical guilty pleasure?</b>
  <br>A specific song that comes to mind is “A Year Without Rain” by Selena Gomez. But in general I would have to say country.</li>
<li class="li1"><b>What is the first album you ever bought?</b><br>
  Michelle Branch- The Spirit Room</li>
<li class="li1"><b>What is your version of an ideal day in Montreal?</b><br>
  Brunch, wandering around Old Port, lunch in the Plateau, a stroll up Mt. Royal and to top it off, dinner and drinks with friends. (So basically just food, food and food).</li>
<li class="li1"><b>If you could go on a date with one musician, who would it be?</b><br>
  John Legend. I can picture myself sitting atop a piano while he serenades me.</li>
<li class="li1"><b>Describe Effusion in one word:</b><br>
  Magnetic</li>
